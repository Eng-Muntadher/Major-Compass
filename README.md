## Overview

**Major Compass** is a web-based AI-powered platform designed to assist high school graduates in choosing a suitable university major. Selecting a college major is a critical and often challenging decision, and this system aims to reduce confusion and uncertainty by providing personalized, data-driven guidance.

The platform analyzes user inputs such as academic interests, GPA, strengths, and future career goals, then combines rule-based logic with AI-assisted conversational guidance to recommend appropriate college majors. An intelligent chatbot powered by the OpenAI API allows users to interactively explore options and receive tailored explanations and breakdowns.
